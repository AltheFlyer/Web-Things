				<p>Plant cells are eukaryotic cells that differ in several key aspects from the cells of other eukaryotic organisms. These distinctive features include the following:</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A large central vacuole, a water-filled volume enclosed by a membrane known as the tonoplast 
						that maintains the cell's turgor, controls movement of molecules between the cytosol and 
						sap, stores useful material and digests waste proteins and organelles.
					</li>
					<li>
						A cell wall composed of cellulose and hemicelluloses, pectin and in many cases lignin, 
						is secreted by the protoplast on the outside of the cell membrane. This contrasts with the 
						cell walls of fungi, which are made of chitin, and of bacteria, which are made of peptidoglycan.
						Cell walls perform many essential functions: they provide shape to form the tissue and organs of 
						the plant, and play an important role in intercellular communication and plant-microbe interactions.
					</li>
					<li>
						Specialized cell-to-cell communication pathways known as plasmodesmata, pores in the 
						primary cell wall through which the plasmalemma and endoplasmic reticulum 
						of adjacent cells are continuous.
					</li>
					<li>
						Plastids, the most notable being the chloroplast, which contains chlorophyll, a green-colored 
						pigment that absorbs sunlight, and allows the plant to make its own food in the process known
						as photosynthesis. Other types of plastids are the amyloplasts, specialized for starch storage,
						elaioplasts specialized for fat storage, and chromoplasts specialized for synthesis and storage of
						pigments. As in mitochondria, which have a genome encoding 37 genes, plastids have their own 
						genomes of about 100â€“120 unique genes and, it is presumed, arose as prokaryotic endosymbionts
						living in the cells of an early eukaryotic ancestor of the land plants and algae.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cell division by construction of a phragmoplast as a template for building a cell plate late in
						cytokinesis is characteristic of land plants and a few groups of algae, notably the Charophytes 
						and the Chlorophyte Order Trentepohliales.
					</li>
					<li>
						The motile, free-swimming sperm of bryophytes and pteridophytes, cycads and Ginkgo are the only
						cells of land plants to have flagella similar to those in animal cells, but the
						conifers and flowering plants do not have motile sperm and lack both flagella and centrioles.
					</li>
				</ul>
