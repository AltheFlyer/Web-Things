		<h2>Floating divs</h2>
		<div class = "float">I'm floating</div>
		<p class = "text">
		The float property was introduced to allow web developers 
		to implement simple layouts involving an image floating 
		inside a column of text, with the text wrapping around the 
		left or right of it. The kind of thing you might get in a 
		newspaper layout.
		</p>
		<p class = "clear">This text is unaffected.</p>
		<br></br>
		
		<div class = "wrapper">
			<div class = "float large">I'm floating again</div>
			<p>
			But web developers quickly realised that you can float anything,
			not just images, so the use of float broadened. Our fancy 
			paragraph example from earlier in the course shows how you 
			can use float in the creation of a fun drop-cap effect.
